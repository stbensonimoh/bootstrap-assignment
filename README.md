# Bootstrap Assignment
A simple frontend exercise for practicing Bootstrap and CSS skills.

### Assignment Instructions
#### Background
The page you are going to end build can be found [HERE](https://awlo.org/awlc/awlc2020/).
It is a form that was built using `HTML`, `CSS`, `Boostrap.css`, and `animate.css`. You are not required to add the `animated cobwebs` in the background.

You are required to:
1. Create a public GitHub repository of your project with the appropriate commit messages showing your work history (*this will help you practice your Git Workflow skills*).
2. Consult the various documentations provided in the **RESOURCES** section for help.
3. Add `@stbensonimoh` to as a collaborator/contributor on your project repository on GitHub so that I can review your work.
4. Feel free to ask any questions that you might have concerning this assignment.

**Please note that:** The answers to the questions you might have will only point you in the right direction, they will not provide the solutions for you. This exercise will test your research and `Googling` skills, and your ability to follow instructions.

### Resources
Makes sure to use the `CDN` links instead of the `npm` installation where applicable.

**Bootstrap** documentation can be found [HERE](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

**Animate.css** documentation can be found [HERE](https://animate.style/)

You are required to complete this project within **5 days** of starting it.

Good luck!
